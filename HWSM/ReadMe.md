**HWSM**
<br>
**This is the main directory containing the program.**
*HWSM consists of two versions. GUI version and CLI version. They are completely independent and can be used on their own.*

*NOTE*

For this to work, you'll need few python libraries first. I'll work on a way to make it work without it later, but for now you'll need to manually add them via your pip or external package managment system.

Required dependencies:
  - Python: 8 or newer
  - tk: 8.6.16 or newer
  - tcl: 8.6.16 or newer
  - GPUtil: any
    </p>
    
  Python libraries:
  - psutil
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - multiprocessing
  - tabulate
  - threading
  - platform
  - datetime
  - py-cpuinfo

To run this application, simply clone the repository and run the desired python script - either GUI or CLI version. If the script fails to load, you are likely missing the required dependencies or some core files.
