**HWSM**
**This is the main directory containing the program with all it's dependencies.**

*NOTE*
For this to work, you'll need few python libraries first. I'll work on a way to make it work without it later, but for now you'll need to manually add them via your pip or external package managment system.

Required dependencies:
  - Python: Any version
  - tk: 8.6.16 or newer
  - tcl: 8.6.16 or newer
    
  Python libraries:
    - matplotlib
    - psutil
